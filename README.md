## 📌 About the Project

**MaapSetu** is a secure digital platform designed to streamline and manage the verification and re-verification lifecycle of weighing and measuring instruments under the Legal Metrology framework.

The platform connects **instrument owners, Legal Metrology Departments (LMDs), Legal Metrology Officers (LMOs), and Government Approved Test Centres (GATCs)** through a unified digital workflow.

Instead of relying heavily on fragmented/manual processes for applications, scheduling, verification records, certificates, and expiry tracking, VeriMaap provides a centralized digital system for managing these activities.

> **Physical verification remains the responsibility of authorized officers/GATCs. VeriMaap digitizes the workflow, records, evidence, certification and lifecycle management surrounding that verification.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### SIH 26036

**Development of an Online Verification System for Weighing and Measuring Instruments**

Under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and the Legal Metrology (General) Rules, 2011, weighing and measuring instruments used in regulated transactions are required to be periodically verified and stamped.

Existing processes can involve:

* Manual application submission
* Physical documentation
* Manual scheduling
* Assignment of verification activities
* Physical inspection
* Manual recording of observations
* Certificate management
* Difficulty tracking expiry and re-verification
* Fragmented records and systems

The objective of MaapSetu is to bring these workflows into a unified digital platform.

# 🤖 AI-Assisted Features

MaapSetu is designed to use AI where it provides practical value rather than adding AI unnecessarily.







```text
Manufacturer
Model
Serial Number
Capacity
```

Example:

```text
Image
  ↓

  ↓
Extracted Information
  ↓
User Confirmation
  ↓
Instrument Record
```

The extracted information is always reviewed by the user before being saved.

### Future AI Capabilities

The platform can be extended with:

* Document information extraction
* Instrument identity matching
* Image quality checking
* Serial-number mismatch detection
* Smart compliance assistance
* AI-assisted field inspection

AI acts as **decision support**, not as a replacement for authorized Legal Metrology officers.

---

# 📜 Digital Verification Certificate

After a successful verification, MaapSetu can generate a digital verification certificate containing information such as:

* Certificate ID
* Instrument ID
* Owner
* Manufacturer
* Model
* Serial Number
* Capacity
* Verification date
* Validity / due date
* Verification authority
* Verification result
* QR code

The QR code provides a convenient way to access and verify the certificate information.

---

# 🔎 QR-Based Certificate Verification

Anyone with access to the certificate QR code can verify the associated certificate record.

Example:

```text
Scan QR
   ↓
Certificate ID
   ↓
Retrieve Certificate
   ↓
Check Authenticity / Status
   ↓
Display Instrument Information
```

Possible status:

### 🟢 VERIFIED

```text
Instrument: XYZ WM-300
Serial No: 928374
Verified On: DD/MM/YYYY
Valid Until: DD/MM/YYYY

Verification Status:
VALID
```

---

# 📊 Dashboard

### LMD Dashboard

The administrator dashboard can provide an overview of:

```text
Total Instruments
Pending Applications
Scheduled Verifications
Completed Verifications
Failed Verifications
Expiring Certificates
Expired Certificates
```

This allows authorities to monitor verification activities and pending work from a centralized interface.

# 🎯 Project Vision

Our goal is not simply to create another government portal.

The long-term vision of **MaapSetu** is to create a unified digital lifecycle for regulated weighing and measuring instruments:

```text
REGISTER
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
CERTIFY
   ↓
TRACK
   ↓
RE-VERIFY
   ↓
MAINTAIN HISTORY
```

This creates greater transparency, easier compliance, better record management and more efficient monitoring for the Legal Metrology ecosystem.
